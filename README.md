RHadoop Simple Implementations
=================

### Description

The simple codes are developed to implement some algorithms in RHadoop for practice.

RHadoop is a project that integrates *Hadoop* functionality into the statistical language *R*.

### History

The project was originally assigned in a project course held by corporation Trend Micro.

At that time Github account *xxxxxppppp123* was used to upload the project.

### Algorithms

- *word_count.R*: To count the number of words in a text file.
