# RHadoop Project: K-means and Word Count

## Introduction

The simple K-mean and word count algorithms are implemented in RHadoop.

RHadoop is a framework that integrates *Hadoop* functionality into the statistical language *R*.

## History

The project was assigned in a cloud project course, which was held by Trend Micro.

I moved this project code from https://github.com/xxxxxppppp123/RHadoop, because the account is never used now.

## Algorithms

- *word_count.R*: To count the number of words in a text file.
- *k_means.R*: The implementation of a clustering algorithm "K means".
