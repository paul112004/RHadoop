RHadoop Simple Implementations
=================

### Description

The simple codes were developed to implement some algorithms in RHadoop for practice.

RHadoop is a project that integrates *Hadoop* functionality into the statistical language *R*.

### Algorithms

- *word_count.R*: To count the number of words in a text file.
- *kmeans.R*: The implementation of a clustering algorithm "K means".
